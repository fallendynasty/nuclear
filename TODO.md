# TODO

## Movement
- [ ] improve movement code
- [ ] add more movement options (maybe in the future)

## Combat system
- [ ] Add more control over customising weapon behavior (e.g. rockets don't hitscan, lasers have a continuous beam, single-handed or dual wielding pistols, etc.)
- [ ] Inventory (view/equip items & weapons etc.) / Inventory UI
- [ ] Weapon UI (see weapon, ammo, etc.)
- [ ] Items, equipping items, etc. (items can be used as weapons maybe? e.g. throwing an item -> some effect on impact like explosion)
- [ ] Enemies

## Misc
- [ ] procedurally generate the stage (prefab rooms), loot, etc. (seeded)
- [ ] Debug UI (e.g. show player speed, state, weapon equipped, etc.)

# ðŸ’© Ideas
- Can melee with fist if no weapon equipped
- Can have different prefab rooms with 3 random perks (like Hades or Noita)
- Maybe healing should be scarce
- Max health can be increased (or decreased)
- Enemies drop loot, can pick up and use weapons, etc.
- A variety of enemies with their own gimmicks (like Lethal Company)
